Okay, please find the requested table below, crafted with 10 features for the LibManager system tailored for our Tromsø librarians! Get ready to meet our wonderfully quirky Norwegian personas, including a Viking who's slightly out of time but right at home in a library (in a very confusing way for him).

| TITLE | USER STORY | ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA | PRIORITY | ESTIMATION | DESCRIPTION |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Add New Book to System** | As Ingrid "Bokormen" Halvorsen, the Head Librarian with a paper-cut nemesis and a secret passion for Arctic romance novels, I want to easily add new books to the LibManager, so that I can keep our collection up-to-date and brimming with literary treasures, both highbrow and perhaps, someday, *lowbrow*, if you catch my drift... | 1. Librarian can input book title, author, ISBN, category, and storage location.<br> 2. System assigns a unique book ID.<br> 3. Book is marked as 'available' by default upon creation (unless Ingrid is feeling particularly possessive that day).<br> 4. A success message is displayed confirming book addition, preferably with a pleasant little sound, like a gentle 'plink' of a book hitting a digital shelf.  | <span style="color:red">**HIGH**</span> | 3 Story Points | Ingrid Halvorsen, bless her organized heart at 55, is in charge of Acquisitions. Imagine her, armed with a mountain of new Nordic Noir thrillers (and maybe a few hidden romance manuscripts tucked away), wrestling with endless paper forms to log each book. LibManager should feel as intuitive as alphabetizing her spice rack – quick, efficient, and satisfying.  We're talking about rescuing Ingrid from an avalanche of paperwork so she can focus on the *real* literary emergencies, like ensuring Bjørn 'Quiet-Bjørn' Hansen doesn't accidentally shelve the noisy children's books near the tranquil local history section.  Think of the inner peace (and potentially steamy novel writing time) we'll be granting her! |
| **Edit Book Details** | As Mette "Metadata-Mette" Andreassen, the Cataloging Queen with a taxonomy obsession and a slight twitch whenever metadata is misaligned, I need to be able to meticulously edit book details within LibManager, so that our catalog remains pristine, accurate, and a shining beacon of bibliographic correctness for the entire Tromsø library system! | 1. Librarian can search for a book by title, author, or ID to edit.<br> 2. All book fields (title, author, ISBN, category, location, availability) are editable.<br> 3. System logs edit history (because even metadata royalty makes mistakes… occasionally, in another dimension perhaps). <br> 4.  A clear "Save Changes" button must exist, large enough to prevent accidental metadata mayhem caused by clumsy fjord-frozen fingers. | <span style="color:yellow">**MEDIUM**</span> | 2 Story Points |  Mette, at a vibrant 51, lives and breathes metadata.  Picture her, perched over her monitor like a hawk, eyes scanning for rogue commas in author names and ISBNs with an incorrect digit. For Mette, inaccurate book details are not just errors; they are existential threats to the very fabric of library order. LibManager must empower Mette to surgically correct any and all bibliographic imperfections.  Think of this feature as digital white-out for Mette, but fancier, trackable, and without the annoying smell. It’s crucial for her sanity, and frankly, for the entire library functioning under the sheer weight of perfect categorization. |
| **Remove Book from System** | As Astrid "Event-Astrid" Lund, the Children's Librarian, glitter enthusiast, and master of goo-removal from small sticky fingers, I want to easily remove books from LibManager, especially the ones that have suffered… *unspeakable* … fates at the hands of enthusiastic (and occasionally jam-covered) young readers, so that our digital catalog reflects the *actual* state of our, ahem, *sometimes slightly chewed*, collection. | 1. Librarian can search for a book to remove.<br> 2. System prompts for confirmation before permanent removal (Are you *really* sure you want to banish this glitter-bombed picture book to the digital void?). <br> 3. Removed books are ideally archived for statistical purposes (to track the epic battles of books vs. toddlers), not just vaporized from existence.<br> 4.  Optionally, Astrid would appreciate a 'reason for removal' field – options like 'Subjected to Extensive Crayola Art,' 'Spine Decimated by Enthusiastic Reading,' 'Vanished Into the Mysterious Realm Under the Story Time Rug'. | <span style="color:blue">**LOW**</span> | 1 Story Point |  Astrid, eternally 48 in spirit and always sparkly, deals with the *casualties* of the children's section.  Imagine mountains of picture books bravely facing toddlers armed with jam, glitter, and the occasional rogue crayon. Books get loved *hard* in Astrid's domain. LibManager needs to handle the, shall we say, 'retirement' of these battle-scarred veterans gracefully. Think of this feature as a digital Book Valhalla, where books that have given their all can be respectfully archived, perhaps with a little digital Viking funeral (sparkles optional). Astrid will use this feature less often, but when she *needs* to say goodbye to a particularly sticky edition of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," it needs to be easy and maybe just a *tiny* bit therapeutic. |
| **Search for Book by Title** | As Bjørn "Quiet-Bjørn" Hansen, the serene elder statesman of Tromsø Library and sworn enemy of sudden loud noises, I need a quick and efficient way to search for books by title in LibManager, so that I can locate requested titles without disturbing the precious, library-mandated *hysj* (hush), and ideally without having to interact with any… *boisterous*… technology interfaces. | 1.  A prominent search bar is available for title search (ideally muted in calming library grey).<br> 2. System returns accurate search results based on title, even with slight typos because Bjørn's eyesight isn't *quite* what it used to be, even if his library knowledge is as sharp as a freshly sharpened pencil.<br> 3. Search results are displayed clearly, sorted by relevance or, even better, Dewey Decimal, because old habits die hard, even if Dewey himself likely predates Bjørn by a few years. <br> 4.  Bonus points if the search function emits a gentle, calming *shhh* sound upon completion (maybe scrap that idea actually, that’s probably too much). | <span style="color:red">**HIGH**</span> | 2 Story Points | Bjørn, at a venerable 62 (though he swears he's only "sixty-something"), embodies library tranquility. Imagine him, gently shushing a rogue sneeze, needing to find a specific title for a patron without causing any unnecessary… *commotion*.  LibManager’s search needs to be as unobtrusive and efficient as Bjørn’s own legendary library shushing skills. Think of this feature as a digital extension of Bjørn's quiet competence – gets the job done, minimal fuss, maximum serenity. It's about preserving the library’s sacred silence and Bjørn's own well-preserved inner peace, earned through years of whispering book recommendations and mastering the art of the silent stare-down of anyone attempting to eat crisps near the rare book collection. |
| **Search for Book by Author** | As Helga "History-Helga" Pettersen, the Sami history specialist with a passion for Tromsø heritage and a knack for knitting traditional patterns whilst simultaneously devouring historical texts, I need to be able to search for books by author in LibManager, especially focusing on local and Sami authors, so that I can readily access and promote our invaluable collection of regional literary treasures and perhaps knit a new mitten pattern inspired by a particularly well-researched biography. | 1. Author search functionality is readily accessible, separate from or easily togglable with the title search (no accidentally searching for authors in the title field, chaos!). <br> 2. System accurately returns books by the specified author, including variant spellings or those tricky Norwegian last names with extra vowels.<br> 3.  Search results should clearly display author names and titles (Helga appreciates clarity and perhaps a touch of traditional Norwegian font, if aesthetically feasible).<br> 4. Ideally, Helga can filter search results by category (e.g., 'Sami History', 'Tromsø Authors', 'Knitting Patterns Inspired by 18th Century Arctic Expeditions' - okay, maybe not that last one). | <span style="color:yellow">**MEDIUM**</span> | 2 Story Points | Helga, at a culturally rich 41, is the guardian of Tromsø's literary heritage.  Imagine her, needles clicking away in a blur of yarn and local knowledge, needing to pinpoint all works by a specific Sami author for an upcoming cultural event. LibManager's author search needs to be as nuanced and insightful as Helga's understanding of regional literature. Think of this feature as a digital doorway to Tromsø's literary past, empowering Helga to connect patrons with the stories that weave the very fabric of their community, all while keeping her hands busy with an exquisite new wrist warmer for those drafty library corners. |
| **Categorize Books** | As Sven "System-Sven" Olsen, the turtleneck-clad tech enthusiast who dreams in spreadsheets and considers Dewey Decimal positively Jurassic, I want to efficiently categorize books within LibManager using a modern, dare I say, *digital-native*, categorization system, so that I can optimize book organization, generate insightful category-based reports (ooh, data!), and finally drag Tromsø library kicking and screaming into the glorious 21st century of library management. | 1.  Librarian can assign one or more categories to each book (because categories are fluid, Sven argues!). <br> 2. System offers a pre-defined list of categories (adaptable, naturally, because Sven thrives on optimization).<br> 3. Category management should be easy – adding, editing, and perhaps even color-coding categories (for visual appeal, obviously, not frivolous aesthetics… mostly).<br> 4. Sven envisions *nested* categories. Think 'Fiction > Nordic Noir > Tromsø Settings' – organizational nirvana, or as Sven calls it, “just common sense.”  | <span style="color:yellow">**MEDIUM**</span> | 2 Story Points | Sven, a sprightly 32 and powered by black coffee and data-driven insights, views categorization as an art form, a science, and possibly a competitive sport. Imagine him shuddering at the mere mention of Dewey Decimal, yearning for a dynamic, tag-based, algorithmically optimized system of book classification.  LibManager’s categorization feature is Sven’s playground.  Think of this feature as a digital Rubik's Cube for Sven, a puzzle of organizational brilliance just waiting to be solved, re-solved, and then optimized with even *more* subcategories. It's about giving Sven the tools to unleash his inner librarian-optimizer, making the Tromsø library a paragon of 21st-century cataloging efficiency, all while secretly dreaming of replacing all physical books with meticulously tagged e-books someday. |
| **Assign Storage Location** | As Lars "Loan-Lars" Johansen, the circulation desk veteran who's seen it all and knows where every misplaced book *probably* is (even the ones Sven thinks are categorized perfectly), I need to assign and easily view book storage locations in LibManager, so that I can quickly direct patrons to the right shelf, aisle, or possibly that *one* chair in the reading room where someone always leaves the latest Jørn Lier Horst thriller. | 1.  Librarian can specify a storage location for each book (e.g., 'Fiction Shelf 3B', 'Local History Alcove', 'Under Astrid's Story Time Rug – Proceed With Caution'). <br> 2. Storage location field is easily visible on the book details page (big, bold, maybe even with a little shelf icon for Lars’s visual delight). <br> 3.  Ideally, Lars can create and manage storage locations (because shelves mysteriously rearrange themselves in the dead of night, probably by library gnomes). <br> 4.  A search for storage locations would be *chef’s kiss* – Imagine Lars typing 'Fiction Shelf 3B' and getting a list of books located there. Pure circulation desk magic! | <span style="color:yellow">**MEDIUM**</span> | 2 Story Points | Lars, a friendly 39 with eyes that see all and ears that hear everything, is the library's human GPS. Imagine him fielding endless inquiries of "Where's that new thriller, again?" while simultaneously remembering overdue fines from 1998 and politely suggesting alternative reading to indecisive patrons. LibManager's storage location feature is Lars's secret weapon against library chaos. Think of this feature as a digital floor plan of the library, encoded in every book record, making Lars the ultimate book-finding guru. It’s about empowering Lars to keep the book traffic flowing smoothly, the shelves organized, and the patrons happily buried in their chosen literary adventures (wherever they may be geographically within the library's sprawling floor plan). |
| **Mark Book Availability Status** | As Solveig "Statistics-Solveig" Bakken, the data analysis dynamo with a dashboard for everything (including optimal tea brewing temperature), I need to be able to easily mark books as 'available' or 'unavailable' in LibManager, so that I can generate accurate availability reports, track book circulation trends with scientific precision (because everything is better with charts!), and finally prove that Bjørn *actually* borrows more Nordic Noir than he lets on (for *research purposes*, naturally). | 1. Librarian can quickly toggle book availability status (available, checked out, lost, being dramatically rebound, etc.).<br> 2. Availability status is clearly displayed on book details and in search results (ideally with color-coding, because Solveig *lives* for color-coded data visualizations). <br> 3. System records history of availability changes (essential for trend analysis, obviously).<br> 4. Solveig secretly hopes for an 'availability prediction' feature – imagine the possibilities! – but for now, accurate tracking is a solid first step. | <span style="color:red">**HIGH**</span> | 3 Story Points | Solveig, a meticulously efficient 28-year-old, sees the library as a giant dataset waiting to be analyzed. Imagine her, surrounded by spreadsheets, pie charts, and a caffeine-fueled determination to unlock the secrets of book circulation patterns in Tromsø. LibManager’s availability feature is Solveig’s data goldmine. Think of this feature as a digital pulse monitor for the library collection, feeding Solveig a constant stream of availability data for her analytical wizardry. It’s about giving Solveig the raw material she needs to build her dashboards of bookish insights, optimize resource allocation, and perhaps, finally settle the age-old librarian debate:  *Which genre is *actually* the most popular in Tromsø on a Tuesday afternoon in November?* (Spoiler: it’s probably Nordic Noir). |
| **View Books in a Category** | As Finn "Foreign-Finn" Nguyen, the newcomer with fresh eyes and a mission to organize the foreign language section (currently resembling a literary United Nations meeting gone slightly awry), I need to be able to easily view all books within a specific category in LibManager, so that I can curate thematic collections, ensure logical shelving, and finally bring order and perhaps a touch of Zen-like tranquility to the currently chaotic landscape of international literature. | 1.  Librarian can select a category (or Sven’s lovely nested subcategories) and view a list of all books assigned to it.<br> 2. Book list should be sortable by title, author, etc. (because Finn appreciates a well-sorted list almost as much as a perfectly brewed cup of Vietnamese coffee).<br> 3. Display includes key book details – title, author, availability (for easy inventory checks during moments of category-induced contemplation).<br> 4.  Ideally, Finn could print category lists – useful for shelf labels, themed displays, and impressing visiting dignitaries from foreign consulates with the library’s impeccable organization (and extensive collection, of course!). | <span style="color:blue">**LOW**</span> | 1 Story Point | Finn, a bright and enthusiastic 25, brings a breath of fresh air (and expert coffee-making skills) to Tromsø library. Imagine him, politely battling linguistic bookshelf chaos, armed with a desire for order and a deep respect for diverse literary voices. LibManager’s category view feature is Finn’s digital broom for sweeping through the foreign language section. Think of this feature as a virtual tour guide through the library’s categorized collections, helping Finn bring clarity to the multilingual literary landscape and ensuring that even the most obscure Latvian poetry collection finds its rightful place on the shelf. It's about empowering Finn to create thematic islands of literary delight amidst the ocean of books, and perhaps, just perhaps, discover a hidden Norwegian translation of a classic Vietnamese epic in the process. |
| **See Book Availability Status (Quick View)** | As Ragnar "The Viking" Haraldsson, a time-displaced warrior from the 9th century struggling to understand "these glowy book boxes," but surprisingly keen on "knowledge hoarding," I need a *very* simple way to see if a "knowledge scroll" (book) is "present" (available) or "gone raiding" (checked out) in this… LibManager thingy, because all these glowing symbols and words are frankly making my ancient Norse brain feel like it’s been hit by Thor's hammer (and not in a good way). | 1. Availability status for each book is displayed using simple, *extremely* clear visual indicators – green for available (like a spring meadow), red for unavailable (like a bloodied battlefield – though perhaps too graphic, let's stick to a simple red dot), maybe even icons – open book/closed book. <br> 2. Status is visible on all book listings – search results, category views, etc. – because Ragnar's patience for clicking multiple times is approximately zero.<br> 3. No complex terminology!  Terms like 'available' and 'unavailable' are just about manageable for a Viking who thinks runes are cutting-edge tech.  Anything more and Ragnar might just start looking for his battle axe to 'fix' the problem. <br> 4.  Bonus if the ‘unavailable’ status has a *very* short and Viking-friendly explanation – “Taken!” or “Looted!” or “Valhalla Bound!” – okay, maybe “Checked Out” is still the most librarian-appropriate, but Ragnar might appreciate the Viking options in spirit. | <span style="color:red">**HIGH**</span> | 2 Story Points | Ragnar, roughly 1200 years young (but a surprisingly spry 40 in librarian years, in his own estimation), is our resident Viking enigma. Imagine him, bewildered by modern technology but strangely captivated by the concept of libraries as digital knowledge hordes. LibManager needs to be *Viking-proof*. Think of this feature as translating library availability into a language Ragnar understands – simple visual cues that even a warrior more familiar with runes and raiding than responsive design can grasp. It’s about making the wonders of digital library management accessible even to those who think the internet is a mythical sea serpent and iPads are some form of advanced shield technology. And who knows, maybe LibManager will finally convince Ragnar that knowledge *is* indeed power… perhaps even more powerful than a really sharp axe (though don’t tell him we said that). |

This table should give you a good laugh while fulfilling all the criteria. Let me know if you want any tweaks or *even more* Norwegian quirkiness!
