    Tests for standalone validation functions (if any).

    Note: Most data validation in this application is handled by:
    1. Model field definitions (e.g., max_length, choices, unique constraints).
       These are typically tested in test_models.py by attempting to save invalid data.
    2. Serializer validation (e.g., required fields, password matching, custom validate methods).
       These should ideally be tested in test_serializers.py.

    This file is reserved for any validation logic that exists outside of
    models or serializers. Currently, it appears such logic might not be present
    or has been integrated into serializers.
